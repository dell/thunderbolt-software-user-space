/**
 * @brief This class wraps-around POSIX file interface for C++ style usage
 *
 * The class encapsulates the actions to be type-safe, translates errors to
 * exceptions so they will not get ignored and implements RAII-style handling of
 * the file.
 *
 * The operations work on the file as whole, e.g. reading the whole file
 * together, as this is the only use-case we need right now.
 *
 * The assumption here is that the class is used only for sysfs files (e.g. non-
 * seekable).
 *
 * The reason all this is done instead of simply using the already existing C++
 * streams is because we need the real errno value in case of an error, while
 * streams return a generic error even while setting the stream to throw on
 * error and can easily overwrite errno by other actions done after the failing
 * operations.
 * C functions could be used instead of POSIX but write error doesn't appear
 * until flushing the file, so POSIX is a better choice for this use-case.
